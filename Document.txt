Assessment Tasks for "Multidimensional Arrays" Topic
Task 1: Print Elements of a 2D Array
Problem:
Write a program that initializes a 2D array of integers and prints each element of the array.

Details:

Variable to be used:

int[][] arr1 (2D array of integers).
Values to be initialized:

arr1 should be a 2D array with values {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}.
Operation to be performed:

Loop through each row of the 2D array.
Inside each row, loop through each column and print the value at that position.
Expected Output:

The program should print the following:
java
Copy code
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Explanation: The program prints the elements of the 2D array row by row.

Task 2: Find the Length of a Row in a 2D Array
Problem:
Write a program that prints the length of a specific row from a 2D array.

Details:

Variable to be used:
int[][] arr2 (2D array of integers).
Values to be initialized:
arr2 should be initialized with {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}.
Operation to be performed:
Find the length of the row at index 1 (i.e., second row) using arr2[1].length.
Expected Output:
The program should print:
java
Copy code
Length of row 1: 3
Explanation: The length of the row at index 1 (second row) is 3 since it has 3 elements.

Task 3: Find the Maximum Value in a 2D Array
Problem:
Write a program that finds the maximum value in a 2D array of integers.

Details:

Variable to be used:
int[][] arr3 (2D array of integers).
int max (variable to store the maximum value).
Values to be initialized:
arr3 should be initialized with {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}.
Operation to be performed:
Loop through each element of the 2D array.
Keep track of the largest value encountered.
Expected Output:
The program should print:
java
Copy code
Maximum Value: 9
Explanation: The program compares each element and finds the largest value, which is 9.

Task 4: Sum of Elements in a Row of a 2D Array
Problem:
Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all elements in a specific row of a 2D array.

Details:

Variable to be used:
int[][] arr4 (2D array of integers).
int sum (variable to store the sum of elements).
Values to be initialized:
arr4 should be initialized with {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}.
Operation to be performed:
Sum all the elements of the second row (index 1).
Expected Output:
The program should print:
java
Copy code
Sum of row 1 elements: 15
Explanation: The second row is {4, 5, 6}, and the sum of its elements is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Task 5: Transpose a 2D Array
Problem:
Write a program that transposes a 2D array (converts rows to columns and vice versa) and prints the transposed array.

Details:

Variable to be used:

int[][] arr5 (2D array of integers).
int[][] transposed (2D array to store the transposed result).
Values to be initialized:

arr5 should be initialized with {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}.
Operation to be performed:

Create a new 2D array transposed with dimensions swapped (i.e., arr5[0].length rows and arr5.length columns).
Loop through arr5 and assign the values to transposed such that transposed[j][i] = arr5[i][j].
Expected Output:

The program should print:
java
Copy code
Transposed Array:
1 4
2 5
3 6
Explanation: The rows and columns are swapped. The first row of arr5 becomes the first column in transposed, and so on.
